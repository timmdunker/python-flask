# python-flask
Server & Back-end.

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. This project is about learning how to use and implement Flask and at the same time increase the knowledge of Python and HTML.

In order to use this project, you need to set up a virtual python enviornment for Visual Studio and make sure Flask is installed as well (Flask can be found on the Python Package Index website: https://pypi.org/project/Flask/).

Once the plugins are installed, the development server can be started by running the file runserver.py. This server is hosted locally.
